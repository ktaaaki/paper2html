## Installing and running paper2html server

### Docker

```shell
$ docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 ghcr.io/ktaaaki/paper2html
```

Use with care as it opens up the port.

### Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu

```shell
$ sudo apt install poppler-utils poppler-data
$ git clone https://github.com/ktaaaki/paper2html.git
$ pip install -e paper2html
$ python3 ./paper2html/main.py
```

### macOS

```shell
$ brew install poppler
$ git clone https://github.com/ktaaaki/paper2html.git
$ pip install -e paper2html
$ python3 ./paper2html/main.py
```

### Windows

Download `Poppler for Windows` binary file from <http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/>  
Please set the `Poppler for Windows` path(ex.`C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\Downloads\poppler-0.68.0\bin`) in the PATH environment variable.

Verify that the path is displayed with the following command.

```powershell
> where.exe pdfinfo
```

Download the zip file or use `git clone` command to save the paper2html code locally, and then install it using the following command.

```powershell

> python .\paper2html\main.py
```

## Usage

### Conversion PDF on the web to html with paper2html server

Upload a PDF file to the server by using this bookmarklet.

```js
javascript:var esc=encodeURIComponent;var d=document;var subw=window.open('http://localhost:5000/paper2html/convert?url='+esc(location.href)).document;
```

Click on the bookmarklet when you open a PDF paper in your browser.  
Then the conversion will start and the generated html will be opened after a while.

You can see the list of converted documents in the index page `localhost:5000/paper2html/index.html`

NOTEðŸ‘‰ If you are running a paper2html server on Docker, you will not be able to convert PDF file on the host OS with the bookmarklet. See [docker image doc](docker/README.md).

### Conversion local PDF to html with CLI

Run this command, then open the html file in your browser.

```shell
$ python paper2html/commands.py "path-to-paper-file.pdf"
```

In IPython, do it like this.

```pycon
>>> import paper2html
>>> paper2html.open_paper_htmls("path-to-paper-file.pdf")
```

You can use specific browser.

```shell
$ python paper2html/commands.py "path-to-paper-file.pdf" --browser_path="/path/to/browser"
```

You can also only convert without opening a browser.

```pycon
>>> import paper2html
>>> paper2html.paper2html("path-to-paper-file or directory")
```
